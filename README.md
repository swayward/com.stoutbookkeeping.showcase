    HTML & CSS: Website basics. I did a lot of CSS to make the site appear the same as before.
    Bootstrap 5.3.3: Bootstrap is a Javascript & CSS framework.
    PHP: I used PHP on this site to glue parts of the page together. Since the content area is the only part that changes, I import the other parts of the page. It is also used to show which menu item is the active page as well as change the page title.
